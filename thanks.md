Many people helped me along my way, and without them Microdot probably would
never see the light of day. Here's a short list of people who I want to thank:

* [Laurent Bercot](http://skarnet.org): recommended me to the #musl channel

* richfelker: author of [musl-libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) and admin of the
	#musl irc channel

* [hazel](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/user/hazel-1029471/), and
	many other members from [linuxquestions.org](https://www.linuxquestions.org)
	, who answered a lot of my questions

* people from the [busybox mailing list](lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox)

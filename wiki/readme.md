# Microdot Wiki Overview

- Section 1: prerequisites, background information, and build environment setup
- Section 2: constructs the musl-based cross compilation toolchain
- Section 3: builds a minimum Linux system to demostrate how various parts
	of the system work together
- Section 4: tutorials for more specific topics, such as kernel fine tuning,
	porting Microdot to other architectures, installing other programs, etc.
	This section will probably contain a lot of work contributed by other users.
	For more details, see the `readme.md` file inside `4_beyond`.

# The Need for Cross Compiling

What does "_compile_" mean? Why do we need to "_cross compile_"?

Excellent articles written by other people that explains these concepts:

* [Introduction to cross-compiling for Linux](http://landley.net/writing/docs/cross-compiling.html)
* [GCC Cross-Compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-compiler)

Of course, you can always ask Google for more related to these topics.
The more you know, the easier this will be!
